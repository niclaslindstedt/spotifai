# spotifai

> A Rust CLI for managing your Spotify library and playlists via natural-language queries, powered by zag (agent) and zad (Spotify integration).

## Synopsis

```
spotifai [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

## Description

_What this command does and when to reach for it._

## Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `install`  | Walk the four-step setup that makes `spotifai api` usable: download the pinned zad binary into `~/.spotifai/bin/zad`, bootstrap the local Ed25519 signing key, scaffold every per-profile file under `~/.spotifai/permissions/`, and sign each one so zad's load-time trust check passes. Idempotent. |
| `auth`     | Forward to `zad service create spotify` (global scope) to register a Spotify Client ID and run the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow. |
| `api`      | Forward to `zad spotify …` after verifying the pinned zad binary. Requires the active profile (set by `ask` or `playlist`); direct shell invocations error out. The forwarded child gets `ZAD_PERMISSIONS_PATH` pinned to the matching `~/.spotifai/permissions/<profile>.toml`. |
| `ask`      | Read-only zag session about the user's Spotify library, with `~/.spotifai/permissions/ask.toml` injected into the system prompt. |
| `playlist` | zag session that builds one new playlist for the user, with `~/.spotifai/permissions/playlist.toml` injected. Adds `playlists create`, `playlists add`, and `playlists rename`; destructive verbs stay denied. |
| `export`   | Dump the user's Spotify library — liked tracks, saved albums, and playlists with full ordered track lists — into one structured JSON document. Designed to be portable enough to re-import on another music service later. Defaults to stdout; `--output` redirects to a file. |
| `help`     | Show help text. |

### `spotifai install`

Walks a four-step guided setup. Each step prints a header so a first-time user can see what is happening.

1. **Install zad binary.** Ensures `~/.spotifai/bin/zad` matches the version pinned in `.zadrc` (baked in at build time). Spotifai forward-routes its `api …` subcommands to this exact path, so the binary on `$PATH` is intentionally never used. Re-runs are no-ops once the right version is present.
2. **Bootstrap signing key.** Runs `zad signing init`, which mints a fresh Ed25519 keypair in the OS keychain (account `signing:v1`) and writes a self-signed empty trust store at `~/.zad/signing/trusted.toml`. Idempotent — when a key already exists, the command prints its fingerprint and leaves the keychain untouched.
3. **Write default permission profiles.** Scaffolds every per-profile file under `~/.spotifai/permissions/`. `ask.toml` ships read-only (allows `search`, `playlists list/show`, `library tracks/albums list`; denies every mutating verb). `playlist.toml` adds `playlists create`, `playlists add`, and `playlists rename` for the `spotifai playlist` command; `playlists delete`, `playlists remove`, and library writes stay denied. Hand-edits to existing files are preserved across re-runs.
4. **Sign permission profiles.** Runs `zad spotify permissions sign --local` once per profile, with `ZAD_PERMISSIONS_PATH` pinned at the matching `~/.spotifai/permissions/<profile>.toml`. zad ≥ 0.4.0 fails closed at load time on permission files that are not in the per-machine trust store; signing here is what unblocks the first `spotifai api …` call. The step runs unconditionally on every `install` invocation, so re-running `spotifai install` after a hand-edit resigns every file.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--force` | bool | false | Re-download the zad binary even if the existing one already matches the pinned version. (Does not overwrite existing permissions files; signing always re-runs regardless.) |

### `spotifai auth`

Runs `~/.spotifai/bin/zad service create spotify` to register Spotify OAuth credentials (Client ID + refresh token) at zad's global scope. Spotify only issues one developer app per user, so the credential intentionally lives at `~/.zad/services/spotify/config.toml` and applies to every directory `spotifai api …` is invoked from. See [`auth.md`](auth.md) for the full reference, including which zad flags pass through.

### `spotifai api`

Forward-routes everything after `api` to `~/.spotifai/bin/zad spotify …`, with `ZAD_PERMISSIONS_PATH` injected so the file backing the **active profile** is consulted. The active profile is selected by the parent `spotifai ask` or `spotifai playlist` command via the `SPOTIFAI_PROFILE` env var; direct shell invocations exit with a usage error pointing the user at those commands (or at running `~/.spotifai/bin/zad spotify …` directly with `ZAD_PERMISSIONS_PATH` set by hand). See [`api.md`](api.md) for the full reference.

### `spotifai ask`

Start an interactive zag session pre-loaded with a system prompt that explains how to use `spotifai api …` and injects `~/.spotifai/permissions/ask.toml` so the agent self-restricts to the listed verbs.

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[query…]` | string | — | Optional opening question. Joined with spaces and used as the agent's first turn. With no argument the session opens empty and waits for the user to type. |

The agent talks to Spotify only through `spotifai api …` (no direct Spotify Web API calls), and is instructed in the system prompt never to widen the policy itself. To loosen the surface, edit `~/.spotifai/permissions/ask.toml` directly — the file is re-read on every `spotifai ask` invocation, and `spotifai install` resigns it. Run `spotifai install --force` to rewrite the binary; the permissions file is never overwritten without your edit.

### `spotifai playlist`

Start an interactive zag session pre-loaded to build a new Spotify playlist for the user. Loads `~/.spotifai/permissions/playlist.toml`, which extends the `ask` policy with `playlists create`, `playlists add`, and `playlists rename`. Destructive verbs (`playlists delete`, `playlists remove`) and library writes (`library tracks save/unsave`, `library albums save/unsave`) stay denied even in this profile.

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[query…]` | string | — | Optional brief (e.g. `"a 30-min focus playlist"`). Joined with spaces and used as the agent's first turn. With no argument the session opens empty and waits for the user to type. |

Like `ask`, the agent in `playlist` only talks to Spotify through `spotifai api …` and is instructed not to widen the policy itself. Edit `~/.spotifai/permissions/playlist.toml` and re-run `spotifai install` to resign the file when you change `allowed` / `denied`.

### `spotifai export`

Walk the user's Spotify library and write one JSON document containing every record needed to recreate the library elsewhere — liked tracks, saved albums, and playlists with full ordered track lists. Reuses the read-only `ask` permission profile (no new profile to scaffold or sign). Records are embedded verbatim under the envelope, so any identifier zad already exposes (`isrc`, `spotify_id`, `added_at`, position, duration, …) flows through to a future importer.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--output PATH`, `-o PATH` | path | — | Write the JSON document to this file instead of stdout. Parent directories are created if needed. |
| `--pretty` | bool | false | Pretty-print the JSON with two-space indent. |

The JSON document goes to stdout by default; status messages always go to stderr so `spotifai export | jq …` and `spotifai export > library.json` work as expected. See [`export.md`](export.md) for the full reference, including the envelope schema.

## Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--version` | bool | false | Print version and exit. |
| `--help`    | bool | false | Print help and exit. |
